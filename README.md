# react-tetris

Tetris implemented in React.

To run:
1) Clone the directory
2) Run 'node http_server.js'
3) Open browser to http://localhost:8082/tetris.html. Note that simply opening the html file from a folder doesn't work since we are using an in-browser JSX transformer. See http_server.js for more details.
